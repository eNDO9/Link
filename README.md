# Link: A Network Graph Visualization Tool

Link is an interactive tool designed for creating and analyzing customizable network graphs from CSV data. It supports various graph types and allows selection of nodes, edges, and attributes for in-depth analysis.

This tool was created for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. It is ideal for researchers, analysts, and organizations working with relational data, such as social network interactions or entity mapping.

Special thanks to the Streamlit and NetworkX communities for their support.
